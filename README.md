This is a Rock - Paper - Scissors game.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and I'm also using React Hooks.

You can visit the GitHub project page [here](https://ioanacosmina.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) to test the app or just clone the repository.

## Improvement ideas
âœ… Add extra variables to the game to increase difficulty (e.g. Lizard, Spock)

--> Scissors cuts Paper
--> Paper covers Rock
--> Rock crushes Lizard
--> Lizard poisons Spock
--> Spock smashes Scissors
--> Scissors decapitates Lizard
--> Lizard eats Paper
--> Paper disproves Spock
--> Spock vaporizes Rock
